            <p><b>Vermeer was born and raised in Delft. There are no paintings here but two of his outdoor scenes can be found as well as his home and burial site.</b></p>
            <h4>Born</h4>
            <p>I took the Eurostar train here. You can take the route directly from London to Rotterdam. From Rotterdam, Delft is a 15 minute taxi or InnerCity train away.</p>
            <h4>Childhood</h4>
            <p>This small city is excellent. I spent a day and a half walking all over the city, exploring alleyways, taking a lot of photos and visiting the Vermeer-related sights. If I could, I'd move to Delft in a heartbeat!</p>
            <p>I've made a more detailed page for this visit that covers all the specific locations, see the <a href="delft.html">Vermeer's Delft</a> page. </p>
